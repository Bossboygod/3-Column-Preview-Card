### What I learned

This particular challenge broadened my knowledge more on the use of flexbox, border and padding. Media Queries also were a major focus in this challenge.

@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .container{
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 280px;
        margin:7% 10% 0 10%;
    }
}

### Continued development

- Flex
- Media Queries
- padding
